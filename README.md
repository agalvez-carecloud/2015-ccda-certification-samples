2) The SITE team will receive the email and create a JIRA ticket in the SITE JIRA project for tracking internally.
3) The SITE team will confirm the validity of the user access credentials with the Certification Team (via email or otherwise). 
4) On verification of access need and credentials, the SITE team will add the account to the GitHub ATL admin group.
